# üõ†Ô∏è Unix File Permissions and File Reading Commands

This document explains file permissions in Unix/Linux, how to modify them with commands like `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`, and others, as well as file reading commands such as `cat`, `nano`, etc.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª File Permissions in Unix/Linux

Unix-like systems use a set of file permissions to define who can read, write, or execute a file. These permissions are typically assigned to three categories of users:

- **User (u)**: The owner of the file.
- **Group (g)**: Users who are in the same group as the file's group.
- **Others (o)**: All other users on the system.

Each permission is represented as a single character:
- **r**: Read permission (view the contents of the file)
- **w**: Write permission (modify the contents of the file)
- **x**: Execute permission (run the file as a program)

### Viewing File Permissions
Use the `ls -l` command to view the file permissions.

Example:
```bash
ls -l filename
```
Output:
```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 1234 Apr 7 14:12 filename
```
This shows the file's permissions, owner, group, size, and other details.

The first three characters `rwx` refer to the user's permissions, the next three `r-x` refer to the group's permissions, and the last `r-x` refer to others' permissions.

## üîë `chmod` ‚Äì Change File Permissions

The `chmod` command is used to modify the permissions of a file or directory.

### Syntax:
```bash
chmod [options] mode filename
```

- **mode** can be either symbolic (using `r`, `w`, `x`) or numeric (using numbers to represent the permissions).

### Symbolic Mode:
| Symbol | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `+`    | Add permission |
| `-`    | Remove permission |
| `=`    | Assign exact permission |

For example, to add execute permission for the user:
```bash
chmod u+x file.txt
```

### Numeric Mode:
Each permission is represented by a number: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute.
- **rwx** = 4+2+1 = 7
- **rw-** = 4+2 = 6
- **r--** = 4 = 4

To set read-write-execute permissions for the user, and read-execute for group and others:
```bash
chmod 755 file.txt
```

### Example:
```bash
chmod u+x script.sh   # Add execute permission to user
chmod 644 file.txt     # Read and write permissions for user, read for group and others
```

## üë• `chown` ‚Äì Change File Owner and Group

The `chown` command changes the owner and/or group of a file or directory.

### Syntax:
```bash
chown [options] new_owner:new_group filename
```

### Example:
```bash
chown john:admins file.txt   # Change owner to john and group to admins
```

If you only want to change the owner:
```bash
chown john file.txt   # Change owner to john
```

To change only the group:
```bash
chown :admins file.txt   # Change group to admins
```

---

## üè∑Ô∏è `chgrp` ‚Äì Change Group Ownership

The `chgrp` command is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.

### Syntax:
```bash
chgrp [options] new_group filename
```

### Example:
```bash
chgrp admins file.txt   # Change the group of file.txt to admins
```

---

## üìë `cat` ‚Äì Concatenate and Display File Contents

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file or combine multiple files.

### Syntax:
```bash
cat [options] filename
```

### Options:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-n`   | Number all lines |
| `-b`   | Number non-empty lines |
| `-E`   | Display `$` at the end of each line |

### Example:
```bash
cat file.txt      # Display contents of file.txt
cat -n file.txt    # Display contents with line numbers
```

---

## üìù `nano` ‚Äì Command-Line Text Editor

`nano` is a terminal-based text editor that allows you to create and edit text files.

### Syntax:
```bash
nano [options] filename
```

### Example:
```bash
nano file.txt    # Open or create file.txt for editing
```

Once inside `nano`, use the following shortcuts:
- `Ctrl + X` to exit
- `Ctrl + O` to save
- `Ctrl + W` to search

---

## üîé `more` ‚Äì View File Contents (Page by Page)

The `more` command allows you to view the contents of a file one page at a time.

### Syntax:
```bash
more filename
```

### Example:
```bash
more largefile.txt   # View file contents page by page
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è `less` ‚Äì View File Contents (Page by Page, with Navigation)

`less` is similar to `more`, but with more navigation options.

### Syntax:
```bash
less filename
```

### Example:
```bash
less largefile.txt   # View file contents with navigation options
```

While viewing the file in `less`, you can use:
- `Up/Down Arrow` to scroll through the file
- `q` to quit
