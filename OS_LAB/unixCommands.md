# 🧰 Essential Unix/Linux Command Reference

This document provides a quick reference guide to commonly used Unix/Linux commands, their options, and usage examples. Ideal for beginners and intermediate users working in terminal environments.

## 📁 1. `ls` – List Directory Contents

```bash
ls [options] [path]
```

### Most Useful Options:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-l`   | Use a long listing format (detailed) |
| `-a`   | Include hidden files (starting with `.`) |
| `-h`   | Human-readable sizes (e.g., KB, MB) |
| `-R`   | List subdirectories recursively |
| `-t`   | Sort by modification time |

### Example:
```bash
ls -lah /var/log
```

---

## 🗑️ 2. `rm` – Remove Files or Directories

```bash
rm [options] [file/directory]
```

### Most Useful Options:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-r`   | Recursively delete directory contents |
| `-f`   | Force delete without prompts |
| `-i`   | Prompt before each file deletion |

### Example:
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/test_dir
```

⚠️ Be very careful with `rm -rf` — it can delete important system files irreversibly.

---

## 📄 3. `cp` – Copy Files or Directories

```bash
cp [options] source destination
```

### Most Useful Options:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-r`   | Recursively copy directories |
| `-u`   | Copy only when the source is newer |
| `-v`   | Verbose output (show files as they're copied) |
| `-i`   | Prompt before overwrite |

### Example:
```bash
cp -ruv src_folder/ backup_folder/
```

---

## 📂 4. `mv` – Move or Rename Files/Directories

```bash
mv [options] source destination
```

### Most Useful Options:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i`   | Prompt before overwriting |
| `-u`   | Move only if source is newer |
| `-v`   | Verbose output |

### Example:
```bash
mv -iv notes.txt archive/
```

---

## 📎 5. `touch` – Create New Files / Update Timestamps

```bash
touch [filename]
```

### Example:
```bash
touch newfile.txt
```

Creates a new empty file or updates the timestamp if it already exists.

---

## 📝 6. `cat` – Display File Content

```bash
cat [file]
```

### Example:
```bash
cat /etc/hostname
```

You can also concatenate multiple files:
```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```

---

## 🔍 7. `grep` – Search Text in Files

```bash
grep [options] pattern [file]
```

### Most Useful Options:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i`   | Ignore case |
| `-r`   | Recursive search |
| `-n`   | Show line numbers |
| `-v`   | Invert match (select non-matching lines) |

### Example:
```bash
grep -in "error" /var/log/syslog
```

---

## 📜 8. `man` – View Manual Pages for Commands

```bash
man [command]
```

### Example:

man ls
```

Use `q` to exit the manual view.

---

## 📦 9. `mkdir` and `rmdir` – Create and Remove Directories

```bash
mkdir [directory]
rmdir [directory]
```

- Use `mkdir -p` to create parent directories if needed.
- `rmdir` only removes empty directories.

### Example:
```bash
mkdir -p projects/java
rmdir old_directory
```

---

## 🔧 10. `chmod` and `chown` – Permissions and Ownership

### `chmod` – Change File Permissions
```bash
chmod [mode] file
```

Example:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### `chown` – Change File Owner
```bash
chown [owner]:[group] file
```

Example:
```bash
chown user:staff file.txt
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Tips

- Use `--help` with most commands to see options:
  ```bash
  ls --help
  ```
- Combine commands with `&&`, `|`, `>` for pipelines and redirection:
  ```bash
  cat file.txt | grep "hello"
  ```
